Redux-saga, React-virtualized and Styled-components(pure CSS).

App is set to use default posts caching of 2 minutes (can be changed in consts file).

List of posts rendered using React-virtualized.

App is deployed on free Heroku plan, so it has a 15 seconds suspense
upon inactivity, so please be patient on first load ;)
